        <p>PhD, Cornell University<br>
          Department of Political Science, Amherst College</p>
	    <p>Thomas L. Dumm is the William H. Hastie ’25 Professor of Political Ethics at Amherst College. He is the author of six books in political philosophy, and co-editor of two other volumes. He is also a founding editor of the internationally known journal of contemporary political theory, Theory&Event. He specializes in American political thought and critical theory. His most recent book, Loneliness as a Way of Life (Harvard UP, 2008) received international acclaim, and has been translated into Dutch, Italian, and Korean. He new book, My Father’s House: On Will Barnet’s Paintings, will be released later this year by Duke University Press.</p>

        <p>When asked if he was interested in teaching in China, he was delighted. Because of the critical importance of China’s role in shaping the world’s future, an opportunity to interact with young Chinese students in China is an opportunity too good to pass up. He is also very pleased that the course will be offered in Shanghai, which may be considered the world capital of the 21st century.</p>
